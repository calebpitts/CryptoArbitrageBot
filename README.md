# CryptoArbitrageBot
Identifies arbitrage opportunities within exchanges and attempts to execute trades that net a profit

## Instructions
1. Use the crypto_bot_env.yml file in conda before doing anything else.
2. Get Kucoin exchange API credentials. You can do this either with a subaccount or main account. Make sure the API credentials are associated with the account that has USDT in it.
3. Add API credentials and tune parameters in parameters.py

As of 5/9/2021, only KuCoin supported. Binance.US and Binance worldwide are in development. Future plans are to add Kraken.
